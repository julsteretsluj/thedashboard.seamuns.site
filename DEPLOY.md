# Deploy SEAMUNs Dashboard (thedashboard.seamuns.site)

The **"Failed to load module script" (MIME type text/plain)** and **favicon 404** errors happen when the host serves the **source** (repo root) instead of the **built** app. Fix: deploy the **`dist/`** folder after building.

---

## Why the errors happen

- **Root `index.html`** asks for `/src/main.tsx` (uncompiled). The server sends that file with `Content-Type: text/plain`, so the browser blocks it → MIME type error.
- **Favicon** lives in `public/favicon.svg`. When you serve the repo root, the server often doesn’t map `/favicon.svg` to `public/favicon.svg` → 404.

**Fix:** Run `npm run build` and deploy the **contents of `dist/`** as the site root. The built `index.html` loads compiled JS from `/assets/...` with correct MIME type, and `favicon.svg` is at the root of `dist/`.

**If you still see both errors:** The server is serving the **repo root** (source), not `dist/`. Point the server’s **document root** to the **`dist/`** folder (or copy `dist/` contents into the web root). Do not use the project root as the document root.

### Still seeing “main.tsx” in the MIME error?

That means the browser is loading the **source** `index.html` (which has `<script src="/src/main.tsx">`), not the **built** one from `dist/` (which has `<script src="/assets/index-….js">`). So the document root is still wrong.

**Verify:**

1. **View Page Source** on the live site (e.g. right‑click → View Page Source).  
   - If you see `src="/src/main.tsx"` → the server is serving the **project root**, not `dist/`.  
   - You should see `src="/assets/index-….js"` (and a `.css` in `assets/`).

2. **Apache:** Confirm `DocumentRoot` is **exactly** the path to the **`dist`** directory (e.g. `/var/www/thedashboard.seamuns.site/dist`), not the repo root. Then run `sudo apachectl configtest` and restart Apache (e.g. `sudo systemctl restart apache2` or `sudo service httpd restart`). If you use a control panel, change the domain’s document root to that `dist` path and save.

3. **On the server:** Ensure `dist/` exists and contains `index.html`, `favicon.svg`, and an `assets/` folder. If you deploy by copying files, upload the **contents** of `dist/` into the directory that is the document root.

---

## 1. Build locally (to test)

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

The built site is in **`dist/`**. Locally you can run `npm run preview` and open the URL it prints.

---

## 2. Deploy the `dist/` folder

Configure your host so that:

1. **Build command:** `npm run build`
2. **Publish / output directory:** `dist`

Do **not** publish the repo root or `src/` as the site root.

---

### GitHub Pages (with Actions)

1. In the repo: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source:** GitHub Actions.
2. Add this workflow (e.g. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency: group=pages
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: 'npm'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: dist
  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
      - id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

3. After the first push, **Settings → Pages** should show the site URL. If you use a custom domain (e.g. `thedashboard.seamuns.site`), set it there.
4. If the site is **not** at the root (e.g. `username.github.io/thedashboard.seamuns.site/`), set in `vite.config.ts`:

```ts
base: '/thedashboard.seamuns.site/',
```

Then rebuild and redeploy.

---

### Netlify

1. **Build command:** `npm run build`
2. **Publish directory:** `dist`
3. **Base directory:** (leave empty if the repo root is the project)

---

### Vercel

1. Import the repo; framework preset **Vite** is usually auto-detected.
2. **Build command:** `npm run build`
3. **Output directory:** `dist`

---

### Hostinger

Hostinger uses **public_html** as the document root. Deploy the **built** site (contents of `dist/`), not the source.

**Steps:**

1. **Build locally**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   The built site is in the **`dist/`** folder (`index.html`, `favicon.svg`, `assets/`, `.htaccess`).

2. **Open Hostinger**
   - Log in to **hPanel** (or cPanel).
   - Go to **Websites** → your domain → **File Manager** (or “Manage” → “Files”).
   - Open **public_html** for that domain. This is the document root; anything you put here is served at `https://yourdomain.com/`.

3. **Upload the built files**
   - **Option A:** Upload **everything inside** `dist/` into `public_html`:
     - `index.html` (root of public_html)
     - `favicon.svg` (root of public_html)
     - `.htaccess` (root of public_html)
     - `assets/` folder (with the `.js` and `.css` files inside)
   - **Option B:** Clear `public_html` first (keep a backup), then upload the contents of `dist/` so that `public_html` contains only those files.

   Do **not** upload the project root or `src/`. Only the **contents** of `dist/`. The `.htaccess` in `dist/` sets correct MIME types and SPA fallback.

4. **Domain**
   - If this is the main domain for the hosting account, `public_html` is already the root.
   - If you added a subdomain or another domain (e.g. thedashboard.seamuns.site), open **public_html** for that domain (e.g. `public_html` inside that domain’s folder) and upload the same contents there.

5. **Updates**
   - Run `npm run build` again locally, then re-upload the contents of `dist/` to `public_html` (overwrite existing files). Or use FTP/SSH if you prefer.

**If you see the “main.tsx” MIME error:** The server is serving the wrong folder. Ensure only the **contents of dist/** are in `public_html` (you should see `index.html`, `favicon.svg`, `assets/`, `.htaccess` at the top level, and no `src/` or `main.tsx`).

**If you see 404s for `assets/...` or `favicon.svg`:** The built files are missing or in the wrong place. In Hostinger File Manager, open `public_html` and confirm you have `index.html`, `favicon.svg`, `.htaccess`, and an `assets/` folder with the `.js` and `.css` files. If anything is missing, re-run the Hostinger Git deploy (or re-upload the full contents of `dist/`). Open the site at the root URL (e.g. `https://yourdomain.com/`), not a subpath, unless you’ve set `base` in `vite.config.ts`.

#### Hostinger via GitHub (auto deploy)

You can deploy through GitHub so that every push to `main` builds the site and updates Hostinger automatically.

**1. Hostinger – connect Git**

- In **hPanel** go to **Websites** → your site → **Manage** → **Advanced** → **Git**.
- Under **Create a repository** (or **Manage Repositories**):
  - **Repository:** your repo URL (e.g. `https://github.com/julsteretsluj/thedashboard.seamuns.site.git` for public, or SSH URL for private).
  - **Branch:** `hostinger-build` (must match the branch the workflow pushes to).
  - **Install path:** leave empty to deploy into `public_html`, or enter a subfolder.
- Enable **Auto Deployment** and copy the **Webhook URL** (you’ll add it in GitHub).
- If the repo is **private:** in the same Git section, generate an **SSH key**, copy the **public** key, and add it in GitHub: repo → **Settings** → **Deploy keys** → **Add deploy key** (paste key, no write access).

**2. GitHub – webhook**

- Repo → **Settings** → **Webhooks** → **Add webhook**.
- **Payload URL:** paste the Hostinger Webhook URL.
- **Content type:** `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
- **Events:** choose **Just the push event**.
- Save.

**3. This repo – workflow**

The workflow **Build and push to Hostinger branch** (`.github/workflows/deploy-hostinger.yml`) already:

- Runs on every push to `main`.
- Runs `npm ci` and `npm run build`.
- Pushes the **contents of `dist/`** to the branch **`hostinger-build`** (so that branch only contains the built site).

When the workflow pushes to `hostinger-build`, GitHub sends the webhook to Hostinger, which pulls that branch into `public_html`. No manual upload needed after the first setup.

**4. First deploy**

- Push to `main` once (or run the workflow manually from the **Actions** tab). Wait for the workflow to finish so that the `hostinger-build` branch exists.
- In Hostinger Git, click **Deploy** (or **Pull**) so it pulls `hostinger-build` into `public_html`. After that, Auto Deployment will pull on every webhook.

**Note:** If you use **only** Hostinger (not GitHub Pages), you can leave the GitHub Pages workflow as-is or disable it in **Settings** → **Pages** → Source.

---

## 3. Custom domain (e.g. thedashboard.seamuns.site)

**Use one host for the domain.** You can’t have `thedashboard.seamuns.site` pointing to both GitHub Pages and Hostinger. Choose where the site lives, then point DNS only there.

- **GitHub Pages:** Settings → Pages → Custom domain → set `thedashboard.seamuns.site` and follow GitHub’s DNS instructions (e.g. A records or CNAME to `username.github.io`). If you see “Domain does not resolve to the GitHub Pages server,” the domain’s DNS is still pointing elsewhere (e.g. Hostinger)—update DNS at your domain registrar to match GitHub’s docs, then “Check again.”
- **Hostinger:** In hPanel, add the domain or subdomain and use the DNS/Hostinger nameservers Hostinger gives you so the domain points to Hostinger. Don’t set this same domain as a custom domain on GitHub Pages.
- **Netlify / Vercel:** Add the domain in the dashboard and point DNS as instructed.

No change to Vite is needed if the site is served at the root of that domain (`https://thedashboard.seamuns.site/`). Only set `base` in `vite.config.ts` if the app is served in a subpath (e.g. `https://example.com/thedashboard.seamuns.site/`).

## Summary

| Problem              | Cause              | Fix                          |
|----------------------|--------------------|------------------------------|
| MIME type text/plain | Serving source     | Deploy `dist/` after build   |
| favicon 404          | Not serving build  | Same: deploy `dist/`         |

Always use **Build command: `npm run build`** and **Publish directory: `dist`**.

## 4. How to set document root

### GitHub Pages (Source: GitHub Actions)

There is **no document root setting**. The workflow uploads the **`dist/`** folder as the artifact; GitHub Pages serves that artifact as the site root. You don’t set a path—the deployed site **is** the contents of `dist/`.

If you still see MIME or favicon errors:

1. **Actions** tab → open the latest **“Deploy to GitHub Pages”** run → confirm both **build** and **deploy** jobs are green.
2. Hard refresh the site (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R) or try an incognito window (cache may be serving the old page).

### Apache (your own server or shared hosting)

Point the **document root** to the folder that contains the **built** site (the contents of **`dist/`**), not the repo root.

**Option A – Document root = `dist/` folder**

1. Run `npm run build` locally (or on the server).
2. In Apache config, set **DocumentRoot** to the full path of the **`dist`** directory.

Minimal snippet (e.g. in an include or when the VirtualHost is defined elsewhere):

```apache
DocumentRoot "/var/www/thedashboard.seamuns.site/dist"
<Directory "/var/www/thedashboard.seamuns.site/dist">
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
</Directory>
```

Full **VirtualHost** example (e.g. in `httpd.conf` or a file in `sites-enabled`):

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName thedashboard.seamuns.site
    DocumentRoot "/var/www/thedashboard.seamuns.site/dist"
    <Directory "/var/www/thedashboard.seamuns.site/dist">
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

Replace `/var/www/thedashboard.seamuns.site` with the path where your repo (or built site) lives. After a build, the site root must be the **`dist`** folder. **AllowOverride All** lets `dist/.htaccess` (from `public/.htaccess`) apply MIME types and SPA fallback.

**Option B – Copy `dist/` contents into the current web root**

1. Run `npm run build` locally.
2. Upload (or copy) **everything inside** `dist/` (e.g. `index.html`, `favicon.svg`, `assets/`) into your current document root (e.g. `public_html` or `htdocs`). The document root stays as-is; its contents become the built app.

### cPanel (or similar)

1. **Domains** or **Addon Domains** → select the domain (e.g. thedashboard.seamuns.site).
2. Find **Document Root** (or **Root Directory**). It might show something like `public_html` or `thedashboard.seamuns.site`.
3. Change it to the folder that contains **only** the built site—e.g. a subfolder that has the **contents** of `dist/` (e.g. `public_html/thedashboard` where you upload `index.html`, `favicon.svg`, `assets/`), or the path to your **`dist`** folder if the repo is on the server and you run `npm run build` there.

Example: if the doc root is `public_html`, upload the **contents** of `dist/` into `public_html/` (so `public_html/index.html`, `public_html/favicon.svg`, `public_html/assets/` exist). Don’t upload the repo root.

## 5. Workflow failed – how to find the error

1. Go to the repo → **Actions**.
2. Click the **failed** run (red X).
3. Click the **failed job** (e.g. **build** or **deploy**).
4. Expand the **failed step** (red step). The log at the bottom shows the error (e.g. `npm ci` failed, `npm run build` failed, or deploy failed).

**Common causes:**

- **`npm ci` failed:** Run `npm install` locally and commit `package-lock.json` if it changed.
- **`npm run build` failed:** Run `npm run build` locally and fix any TypeScript or build errors, then push.
- **deploy failed:** Ensure **Settings → Pages → Source** is **GitHub Actions** and the **github-pages** environment exists. If another workflow (e.g. “Deploy Next.js site to Pages”) is also deploying to Pages, disable or remove that workflow so only **Deploy to GitHub Pages** runs.

---

## 6. Two workflows (e.g. “Deploy Next.js site to Pages”)

If you see **two** workflows running on each push (e.g. “Deploy to GitHub Pages” and “Deploy Next.js site to Pages”):

- We only want to deploy the **SEAMUNs Dashboard** (Vite app in the repo root), not the Next.js app in `auth0-nextjs-app/`.
- **Remove or disable** the “Deploy Next.js site to Pages” (or any other Pages) workflow: repo → **Actions** → click that workflow → **⋯** (top right) → **Delete workflow**, or delete its file under **.github/workflows/** in the repo.
- Keep only **Deploy to GitHub Pages**, which builds the root app and deploys `dist/`.
